# The V# Compiler

V# is an open source, object-oriented, type-safe, and elegant programming language. My design goal is to create a language that encapsulates simplicity, speed, and safety.
The syntax is derived from a combination of C#, Golang, and more C-style languages. 

# The Rewrite

This is a rewrite of my original compiler [here](https://github.com/WaifuShork/Vivian). I've ultimately decided to create a new repo for it because I'm not sure of the direction I'd like
to take on this language. I'm not even 100% positive on what it will be written in -- as of right now I'm using C++ to see how I like it for a start, but the end goal is ultimately undecided. 

## Side Note

My C++ skills are absolutely atrocious, and the compiler in it's current state is probably riddled with memory leaks. But I'll be improving over the coming weeks :)
